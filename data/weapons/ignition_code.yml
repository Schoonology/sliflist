overview: >
  > *The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in
  the PvE meta for some time"* - [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU)


  > *This thing is horrifying. It's going to remind you of The Mountaintop
  It's like a full-auto GL!* - [Frostbolt](https://youtu.be/jJFV_4Y6p7s)


  Well, I'm not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this
  in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of
  PvE. If there's one Splicer weapon you farm for this season, make it the
  Ignition Code.
